                    <p>When it's time for The Oldest apprentice to give his life to the Master,there is a time for The Holy spirit Challenge. Only the real one,strong enough to face the danger of The swamp creature.<br>The beast lay hunched in the brooding forest on the borderline between The Known and The Unknown. He was part of the latter but he was hungry for fresh meat. He was as large as a bear on it's hind legs and with jaws just as powerful, but his skin was a dull green and the claws he held at the ready looked borrowed from some prehistoric predator, they were twelve inches to the tip and sharper than a butcher's knife.<br> He squinted his red eyes toward the dappled shade of the meadow that surrounded the people village and tensed his muscles ready to pounce. That sunlight would be murder on his delicate skin and almost unprotected retinas. <br>Then came a sound to fill his heart with joy, it was a child, skipping and singing. A child who had not listened to it's mother's warnings about staying away from The Unknown.</p>

                        Once a year, in the day of winter solstice, The Great Master allows his apprentices to bring to the mill their beloved. If the one would solve Master's tasks, she could take her boy home,and he would be free from The Master. But if the Master win,then apprentice should kill his beloved.<br> Favourite Master's task is to find you beloved among the crowd of his apprentices with eyes closed. Or to find your beloved among the crowd of crowes.

                    <p>Master is living due to his apprentices' living power. When the Oldest apprentice die,the ceremony of funeral is on. <br>They stood at the front of the funeral. Everyone's heads were down. Maybe it was them showing respect of maybe there were too afraid to look at what was coming. The coffin was borrowed by six oldest apprentices, all wearing dark capes. The silence dwelled as they entered the Forgotten Cemetry. It wobbled as they carried it to the front and gently placed it down.

                    <p> All Master's apprentices wear tattoos on their bodies. This tattoo is a living thing,with it's own mind and power. <br>As the apprentise became stronger,the tattoo is parasitizing on his or her body,taking away a living power.<br>In slavery my body is a cage for a spirit you cannot touch. You prefer those whose eyes have dimmed, submissive to your abuse and hate those whose eyes burn with the knowledge of your inferiority. A true man is a man of love and integrity, you are neither, an empty shell pretending to be human. Were I to draw your spirit animal from your snarled jaw it would be the serpent, and mine... mine would be a lion not bearing a single mark from your whip.<br>There could have been a reality where we toiled side by side, where each worked with a heart of love to benefit the other - instead you prefer power with a raised whip. There could have been a way for us to laugh and sing, to exchange the prettiest of our ways and learn from the errors of the other. Instead you show me that you own my soul with nickels and dimes, rate my effort in a ledger written by mortal hand. </p>
