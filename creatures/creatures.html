					<p>The beast lay hunched in the brooding forest on the borderline between The Known and The Unknown. He was part of the latter but he was hungry for fresh meat. He was as large as a bear on it's hind legs and with jaws just as powerful, but his skin was a dull green and the claws he held at the ready looked borrowed from some prehistoric predator, they were twelve inches to the tip and sharper than a butcher's knife. He squinted his red eyes toward the dappled shade of the meadow that surrounded the people village and tensed his muscles ready to pounce. That sunlight would be murder on his delicate skin and almost unprotected retinas. Then came a sound to fill his heart with joy, it was a child, skipping and singing. A child who had not listened to it's mother's warnings about staying away from The Unknown.</p>

					<p>The lake keeper take people away from crossing the bridge to the Unknown. Try not to be caught by it.<br> You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you’ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no . . . anything. There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just — exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever . . . lost</p>

					<img class="article__img rightimg" src="creaturesContent/child.jpg" style=" height: 200px;">
					<p>The stories of old, they speak of many truths and many lies. What do you believe? One speaks of the forest that sleeps in the south, the paths that still have the footprints of lost travellers in its dirt. There are tree stumps within, believed to be possessed by the spirits of children, those who were lost and died in the forest and swamps. They tell of spirits who control the trees, see through the trees, trap travellers so they may never leave. </p>

					<img class="article__img leftimg" src="creaturesContent/keepers.jpg" style="width: 40%">
					<p>There is no difference between the poor and the rich,the magician and the simple person for them. They are our Mothers. The ones,giving us hope and power. <br>  They are spirits that call us all to become our best self, to develop deep empathy and kindness for all. They are that spirit that moves us to love a stranger, to cry if they or their children need help. So let us use our higher intelligence to step over these words, these human sounds, as if they were pretty pebbles in a gentle stream, and embrace our future in peace.</p>
